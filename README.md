## Directions for future development
- The <b>email</b> feature is only nominal at this time. It should be developed to actually include account management functionality, including account verification upon signup + account recovery.
- If <b>templates</b> aren't editable, then at least make them <b>duplicable</b>.
- Attach a <b>`new` tag</b> to fill-ins that have been created within the last 24 hours, to display as part of fill-in metadata.
- For fill-ins, change the word <b>'a'/'an'</b> accordingly when followed by a user fill-in word.
- On input, fill-ins could record a <b>`maxVisibilityOnInput`</b> value corresponding to the <b>maximum unredaction</b> with which the user viewed the template while filling it in, which could later be offered as a sort/filter parameter. The idea here is that filling out a template with full redaction leads to very different sorts of fill-ins than filling out a template with partial or no redaction.
- <b>Username and password validation</b> (minimum # of characters, required uppercase/lowercase/special characters, etc.) should be added.
- All screens that require a password should have the option to <b>show or hide</b> it while inputting.
- There are places on the application where it would be helpful to have the user <b>enter their password twice</b>.
- A <b>search</b> feature
